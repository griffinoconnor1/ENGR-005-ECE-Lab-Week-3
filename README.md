The internaltemp code utilizes the microcontroller's internal temperature sensor and a specific formula "IntDegC1" to convert the data stored by the sensor into a readable, celcius temperature.

The externaltemp code utilizes a breadbord setup that includes a temperature senor that is attached to the microcontroller. It reads the ambient temperature and stores it in a variable. A specific formula "IntDegC1" is used to convert the data stored by the sensor into a readable, celcius temperature.
